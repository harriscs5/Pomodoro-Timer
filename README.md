# Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. 
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.

5 Reasons to Use the Pomodoro Technique
---
1. Manage distractions and control your time
2. Increase accountability
3. Improve weekly and quarterly planning
4. Decrease back pain and mental fatigue
5. Maintain motivation

The basic process is as follows:
---
- Start a 25-minute timer.
- Work until the timer rings.
- Take a short, five minutes break.
- Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes).
